This release removes the (implicit) autotool / libtool dependencies and should
fix build errors on CRAN's Solaris and MacOS builders. It also fixes the
valgrind errors.

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.4.3
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.4.3
* win-builder (devel and release)
* Solaris 10 (in a VM)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* GNU make is a SystemRequirements.
  This is needed by the Makefile for the libuv dependency, it is not practical
  to convert this to a POSIX compatible Makefile.
